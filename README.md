# Godot Android Vibration Plugin

This plugin gives your Godot scripts more control over the vibration service for Android devices.
This is my first plugin, please excuse the mess. I'm always open to critique, feel free to poke fun constructively.

## Features
- Control vibration duration
- Control vibration intensity (amplitude)

## Future Plans
- Ability to pass Waveform patterns
- Probably a whole new plugin that merges Android and iOS functionality under one API
